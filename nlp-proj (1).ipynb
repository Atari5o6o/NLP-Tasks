Nevertheless, a primary disadvantage of telemedicine remains its relative inability to perform a complete physical examination, at least not in the same manner one would in clinic.

SSNHL-with an incidence in the United States of 5 to 27 per 100 000 people 1 -is one of the few true otologic emergencies requiring expedited evaluation. Current guidelines recommend the initiation of oral or intratympanic steroids within 14 days of symptom onset. 2, 3 Although 32% to 65% of SSNHL cases recover spontaneously, 4 delay in management may lead to residual tinnitus, vertigo, and permanent hearing loss as well as significant negative impacts on quality of life. 2, 5, 6 Audiometry is the gold standard for diagnosing SSNHL; however, this requires appropriately trained staff and equipment which may not be readily available. Thus, the first step in evaluating a patient with suspected SSNHL begins with a history and physical examination to exclude conductive hearing loss (CHL). 2, 3 Tuning fork tests remain a fundamental part of the otologic examination. Lateralization of the Weber turning fork test (WTFT) to the affected ear has historically differentiated CHL from SNHL. 7 Alternatives to the WTFT such as the hum test and the bandage scratch test have been proposed, but neither of these methods have been appropriately validated for general otology patients. The overall clinical data base studying these alternative tests is thin and external validity was limited as they were performed on patients with normal hearing with simulated CHL or solely on postoperative patients. 8, 9 Given the ubiquity of cellphones, utilization of the native vibration function of a mobile phone as a surrogate for a tuning fork is a newer proposed alternative. One study demonstrated the use of smartphone vibration as a replacement to the WTFT on an inpatient ward, but the external validity of this study was limited as it was performed only on patients with a simulated CHL. 10 Another study performed on 60 consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department with unilateral sudden hearing loss found smartphone vibration as an adequate substitute when a provider may not have access to a tuning fork. 11 Further demonstrating the cell phone vibration test's (CPVT) utility for effective and accurate patient self-administration at home would dramatically enhance the telemedicine encounter for patients with SSNHL.

This includes checking CMV IgG reactivity (both in donors and transplant recipients) before transplantation, use of leucodepletion filters to exclude reservoirs of CMV in leukocytes, use of antiviral prophylaxis such as aciclovir or valganciclovir, and regular surveillance of CMV viral load titers using quantitative PCR. The risk of CMV reactivation is highest in those with CMV serostatus: DÀ/R+ followed by D+/R+ and least for D+/R-. CMV reactivation if it occurs may manifest either as a mononucleosis syndrome with nonspecific febrile illness, myalgia, and a maculopapular rash or as organ-specific CMV disease which may manifest as CMV pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, encephalitis, retinitis, and hematological disturbances. CMV reactivation can also lead to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and similarly the onset of GVHD or its treatment may precipitate a CMV reactivation. When CMV reactivation is detected during viral load monitoring (CMV surveillance), it has to be treated in the preemptive mode even before the onset of organspecific CMV disease. CMV pneumonitis is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Many of the patients with CMV pneumonitis may require respiratory support in the form of invasive or noninvasive ventilation. CMV pneumonitis may be complicated by simultaneous occurrence of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Diagnosis of CMV pneumonitis is generally done by demonstration of CMV viremia, clinical and radiological involvement of lung, and demonstration of CMV in bronchoalveolar lavage, endotracheal secretion, and sputum by qualitative CMV PCR. In rare cases, CMV pneumonitis may occur without CMV viremia. This disease, like other CMV diseases, must be treated aggressively with use of intravenous ganciclovir, cidofovir, or foscarnet. Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIgnormal human immunoglobulin or the more expensive and not readily available CMV-specific immunoglobulin) could be considered as an adjunctive treatment in management of CMV pneumonitis. If CMV-specific immunoglobulin is available and can be afforded, it would be a better choice in management of this condition. CMV colitis manifests generally as diarrhea and abdominal pain along with CMV viremia. Colonoscopic features are suggestive, and biopsy from suspected areas of colon affected by CMV colitis may show CMV inclusions by immunohistochemistry techniques. CMV hepatitis, pancytopenia, and retinitis are other manifestations of CMV disease. The CMV hepatitis is mild but may be superimposed over veno-occlusive disease of the liver and liver GVHD. For management of CMV retinitis, ophthalmological referral is warranted, and in addition to intravenous ganciclovir, intravitreal ganciclovir impregnated implants may have to be considered. The choice of antiviral in management of CMV reactivation depends upon the neutrophil count, renal function of host, and tolerability of oral agents (not useful in case of diarrhea or intestinal GVHD) (Devasia et al. 2018) .', 'cite_spans': [{'start': 3292, 'end': 3313, 'text': '(Devasia et al. 2018)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF13'}], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Viral Infections'}, {'text': 'In the treatment of CMV infection, ganciclovir is used at dose of 5 mg/Kg body weight twice a day through the intravenous route; alternatively, cidofovir may be used if available after prehydration, at 5 mg/Kg body weight once a week intravenous dose. In case of suspected ganciclovir or cidofovir resistance, foscarnet is the drug of choice which is to be used intravenous 60 mg/Kg body weight thrice daily dose. If the patient has got low viral load ( 10,000 copies/ml) and is able to absorb oral medications adequately, valganciclovir at a dose of 900 mg twice daily may be used. Monitoring the patient for drug-induced toxicities is essential, and these may be manifested as nephrotoxicity, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia in the case of ganciclovir, while electrolyte imbalance and nephrotoxicity may be commonly seen in the case of foscarnet and cidofovir. Randomized trials have shown that letermovir was effective in reducing the incidence of CMV infection in patients undergoing HSCT, but this drug is not available in India at present (Kumar et al. 2018) .', 'cite_spans': [{'start': 1052, 'end': 1071, 'text': '(Kumar et al. 2018)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF19'}], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Viral Infections'}, {'text': 'CMV may exhibit antiviral resistance especially against ganciclovir, and in this scenario cross-resistance to cidofovir is likely. So, if there is no significant decrease in CMV viral load levels after 2 weeks of antiviral treatment or there is an increase in CMV viral load despite adequate antiviral treatment, antiviral resistance needs to be suspected in which case foscarnet would be the drug of choice. Antiviral resistance in CMV is mediated through two CMV genes. These are UL97 and UL54. Resistance is more common due to UL97 than due to UL54. Resistance detection for ganciclovir and other CMV-specific antiviral is done using DNA sequencing of the relevant parts of the CMV gene.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Viral Infections'}, {'text': 'Other viral infections which are common during the peri-transplant period include herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2 and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation. These reactivations are largely preventable by aciclovir prophylaxis which is given to all patients in the peri-transplant period. However, if breakthrough infection or reactivation occurs despite prophylaxis, the dose of aciclovir has to be augmented from prophylactic range to therapeutic range. Intravenous treatment with aciclovir is indicated in serious infections and in those who are unable to take oral medications because of malabsorption or mucositis. The dose of aciclovir used to treat HSV reactivation varies between 200 and 400 mg orally five times a day, and, if required, intravenous formulation at a dose of 5 mg/Kg body weight thrice daily may be administered. VZV infection or reactivation in immunocompromised setting may be complicated with pneumonia, hepatitis, and encephalitis. Even in uncomplicated infection or reactivation in peritransplant period with VZV, it is recommended that aciclovir is administered through intravenous route at 10 mg/Kg body weight thrice daily for 7 days at least. A patient with VZV reactivation or primary infection, if in the hospital, should be nursed in a negative pressure isolation room which has separate air vents for the outlet air. It is important to note that viruses including VZV may not be filtered by HEPA filters and the only way to ensure effective isolation of the infectious patient is through appropriate ventilation systems. VZV pneumonitis has higher morbidity and mortality and may require artificial ventilation and ICU admission. In case of such patient, it is important that, only staff immune to VZV be involved in their care to prevent occurrence of secondary cases among staff and other caregivers. This may be ensured either through a history of chicken pox or zoster or history of VZV vaccination or demonstration of anti-VZV IgG antibody levels by enzyme immunoassay (EIA).

Among the atypical pathogens, Legionella is the most important cause of infection acquired in healthcare setting because the organism can proliferate and get transmitted from shower heads and other water supply points which are liable for stagnation, low chlorination, and inadequate or inappropriate temperature control of water. Legionella contamination of hospital water supply is preventable and controllable through chlorination, water heating, and point of use bacterial filters of 0.2 μm pore size. Among the respiratory viral infections, only influenza A and B are preventable through yearly vaccination (John et al. 2018 ).

Some patients with severe respiratory involvement may require mechanical ventilation, airway support along with oxygen therapy, and antiviral and antibacterial treatment to manage secondary bacterial infections (commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae).

In patients with severe and unremitting disease, double dose of oseltamivir for 10 days is clinically justified especially in critical care setting.

The diagnostic method used for fungal infections includes simple techniques based on light microscopy and culture to more complex tools such as antigen detection assays by ELISA and molecular assays like PCR and MALDI-TOF. Candida infection in HSCT patients may manifest as a candidemia which could be primaryas a result of CLABSI, secondary form primary infection in another organ, or MBI-LCBI (mucosal barrier injury laboratory-confirmed blood stream infections) in neutropenic patients including those with GVHD (graft-versus-host disease).The incidence of candidiasis has significantly reduced in recent years after the introduction of effective antifungal prophylaxis. However infection still occur especially those due to improper central line handling, particularly in those patients receiving total parental nutrition (Roychowdhury et al. 2016) . The drug of choice for the treatment of candidemia and disseminated candidiasis is echinocandin which has to be administered intravenously. The minimum treatment of candidemia and disseminated candidemia is 2 weeks but may have to be prolonged to 4-6 weeks in case of deep-seated infection such as hepatosplenic candidiasis, renal candidiasis, candida brain abscess, and infective endocarditis. Surgical drainage may have to be attempted in some cases if feasible. However, surgical intervention may not be feasible in those with severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation abnormalities. The choice of echinocandin will depend on clinical consideration such as potential for hepatic dysfunction and drug interaction. Anidulafungin is an echinocandin which can be administered in patient with liver or renal dysfunction without causing further organ derangement or need for dose modification. The mortality from candidemia remains high (about 40% -30-day all-cause mortality) despite the institution of appropriate antifungal therapy. One of the reasons for the high mortality in candidemia is the occurrence of septic shock in some patients with candida blood stream infection.

Apart from lungs, other organs that could be involved with aspergillosis include the brain, paranasal sinuses, ear, kidneys, and skin, nail, and subcutaneous tissue. The drug of choice for the treatment of aspergillosis is voriconazole which may be administered orally or intravenously. The institution of treatment generally follows diagnosis as per the EORTC-MSG criteria which classify fungal infections into proven, probable, and possible group (Hoenigl et al. 2012) . This classification would require histopathology, high-resolution CT scan, and galactomannan antigen testing by ELISA (along with other host factor, clinical criteria, and microbiological criteria for the diagnosis of mycosis). The duration of treatment of aspergillosis is generally between 3 and 6 weeks depending upon the organ involvement, extent of disease, and response to antifungal therapy. Therapeutic drug level monitoring (TDM) is desirable while treating patient with voriconazole.

In case of MDRTB, the induction phase consists of 6-9 months of kanamycin, levofloxacin, ethionamide, cycloserine, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol and followed by 18 months of levofloxacin, ethionamide, cycloserine, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Mycobacterial Infections'}, {'text': 'There is a significant difference in healthcare cost and possible clinical outcome and infection control implication between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB.

Results: Suspected STEMI patients treated in STEMI networks decreased by 27.6% and patients with confirmed STEMI fell from 1305 to 1009 (22.7%).

The infection spread rapidly, and the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11. 1 By May 1, 2020, more than 1.6 million cases had been diagnosed in 179 countries on 5 continents, with nearly 100 000 confirmed deaths. 1 The Spanish Government activated a State of Emergency on March 14, which restricted the movement of all citizens, except those going to work, to hospitals or health centers, and to financial institutions and those shopping for groceries, pharmaceutics, and basic necessities. 2 The impact of this new disease on societal behavior and on health care system performance is unprecedented in recent history. During the current COVID-19 outbreak, some preliminary reports have highlighted a decrease in the number of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients attending hospitals in Europe and North America, [3] [4] [5] but we have limited information on how the outbreak has affected STEMI networks in terms of delays to reperfusion, revascularization strategies, and clinical outcomes. 6, 7 The objective of this study was to compare clinical characteristics, management, and hospital outcomes in a nationwide cohort between STEMI patients who attended in the first 30 days after the Spanish lockdown during the current COVID-19 outbreak and those who attended in a period prior to COVID-19.', 'cite_spans': [{'start': 817, 'end': 818, 'text': '2', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF33'}, {'start': 1162, 'end': 1165, 'text': '[3]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF34'}, {'start': 1166, 'end': 1169, 'text': '[4]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF35'}, {'start': 1170, 'end': 1173, 'text': '[5]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF36'}, {'start': 1342, 'end': 1344, 'text': '6,', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF37'}, {'start': 1345, 'end': 1346, 'text': '7', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF38'}], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'INTRODUCTION'}, {'text': 'There are 17 regional public service STEMI care networks in Spain, which comprise 83 hospitals capable of performing primary percutaneous coronary interventions (pPCIs) in year-round 24hour, 7-day a week programs.

Furthermore, patients had longer delays to reperfusion, largely due to later consultation of the health system because we found no differences in the time from first medical contact to reperfusion. Ischemic time duration is a major determinant of infarct size in patients with STEMI, and prompt recognition and early management of acute STEMI is critical in reducing morbidity and mortality. [10] [11] [12] Interestingly, the COVID-19 cohort showed a higher prevalence of previous coronary artery disease and more multivessel disease, suggesting that patients with a history of ischemic heart disease may have been less reluctant to go to the hospital. Despite the logistical difficulties caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, we did not detect an increase in the time from first medical contact to reperfusion, which indicates a good adaptation of STEMI networks to the current crisis. On the contrary, there was a longer time from catheterization laboratory arrival to reperfusion, probably due to time spent on the protective measures required for the procedures. 13 Potential behavioral explanations for these results would be a combination of avoidance of medical care due to social distancing and concerns about contracting COVID-19 in hospitals. The ongoing outbreak has received massive news coverage, with particular emphasis on the most common forms of infection and places where SARS-CoV-2 spreads more easily. Fear is a well-known determinant of medical care avoidance 14 and hospital avoidance behaviors have been linked to pandemics. 15 ', 'cite_spans': [{'start': 134, 'end': 135, 'text': '3', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF34'}, {'start': 331, 'end': 332, 'text': '4', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF35'}, {'start': 503, 'end': 504, 'text': '3', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF34'}, {'start': 1105, 'end': 1109, 'text': '[10]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF41'}, {'start': 1110, 'end': 1114, 'text': '[11]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF42'}, {'start': 1115, 'end': 1119, 'text': '[12]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF43'}, {'start': 1775, 'end': 1777, 'text': '13', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF44'}, {'start': 2189, 'end': 2191, 'text': '14', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF45'}], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Fewer STEMI patients and longer delays to reperfusion'}, {'text': 'Various scientific societies have developed recommendations on the reperfusion strategy during the COVID-19 outbreak, with advice that may be conflicting, depending on the conditions in each country.

Here, we report that coupled matrix-tensor factorization (CMTF) can reduce these data into consistent patterns by recognizing the intrinsic structure of these data. We use measurements from two previous studies of HIV-and SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects as examples. CMTF outperforms standard methods like principal components analysis in the extent of data reduction while maintaining equivalent prediction of immune functional responses and disease status. Under CMTF, model interpretation improves through effective data reduction, separation of the Fc and antigen-binding effects, and recognition of consistent patterns across individual measurements.

The unique property of antibodies is conceptually simple-they undergo affinity enrichment toward specific antigens-but the mechanisms of resulting protection are mediated through a network of interactions (Lu et al, 2017) . Therapies are often optimized based upon the titer or neutralizing capacity of the antibodies they deliver. However, many of the mechanisms for antibody-mediated protection occur through secondary interactions with the immune system via an antibody's fragment-crystallizable (Fc) region. Although more challenging to quantify and identify as the mechanism of protective immunity, these immune system responses, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Hessell et al, 2007; Bournazos et al, 2014) , complement deposition (ADCD) (Lofano et al, 2018) , cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) (Osier et al, 2014) , and respiratory burst (Joos et al, 2010) , are known to be just as or more important in many diseases.\", 'cite_spans': [{'start': 389, 'end': 405, 'text': '(Lu et al, 2017)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF36'}, {'start': 875, 'end': 896, 'text': '(Hessell et al, 2007;', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF29'}, {'start': 897, 'end': 919, 'text': 'Bournazos et al, 2014)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF10'}, {'start': 951, 'end': 971, 'text': '(Lofano et al, 2018)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF35'}, {'start': 1003, 'end': 1022, 'text': '(Osier et al, 2014)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF42'}, {'start': 1047, 'end': 1065, 'text': '(Joos et al, 2010)', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF30'}], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Introduction'}, {'text': 'A suite of recent technologies promises to broaden our view of antibody-mediated protection as the microarray did for gene expression.

In these assays, antibodies are first separated based on their binding to a panel of disease-relevant antigens (Brown et al, 2012 (Brown et al, , 2017 . Next, the binding of the immobilized antibodies to a panel of immune receptors is quantified. Other molecular properties of the disease-specific antibody fraction that affect immune engagement, such as glycosylation, may be quantified in parallel in an antigen-specific or -generic manner (Brown et al, 2012 (Brown et al, , 2017 Mahan et al, 2014) .

However, identifying specific molecular changes or programs that give rise to protection is more difficult. First, because many of the measurements are overlapping in the molecules they quantify, or measure co-dependent processes, much of the data are highly intercorrelated Pittala et al, 2019) . Particularly when analyzing polyclonal antibody responses such as those which arise in vaccination or natural infection, protection may arise through single or combinations of molecular species and features within the antibody response, through either individual or combinations of antigens (Ackerman et al, 2016 . One successful approach in serology analysis has been to collapse molecular features into summary statistics, such as Fc breadth or polyfunctionality, although this requires predefined descriptors of these quantities (Ackerman et al, 2016) . Alternatively, patterns of interest can be experimentally derived, such as with blocking experiments, but this is labor-intensive and requires preexisting monoclonal antibodies to define each pattern (Georgiev et al, 2013) .

Most of the measurements quantify the extent to which an antibody bridges all pairs of target antigen and receptor panels, across a set of individuals (Arnold & Chung, 2017) . Binding to the target antigen involves the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of an antibody, whereas immune receptor interactions occur through its Fc region. Thus, it is natural to split them up as they entail different regulatory processes. Along with the dimension of individuals, these measurements, therefore, can be thought of as a three-dimensional dataset, where every number in this \"cube\" of data represents a single measurement (Fig 1A and  B) . Then, separately from these measurements, some properties of the humoral response, such as antibody glycosylation, may be assessed but without separation across different antigens (Ackerman et al, 2013; Mahan et al, 2014) . With data of three or more dimensions, tensor decompositions, a family of unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods for higher order tensors, provide a generalization of matrix decomposition techniques (Kolda & Bader, 2009 ). These methods are especially effective at data reduction when measurements have meaningful multidimensional features, such as time-course measurements (Martino et al, 2020) .

We started by restructuring the HIV infection serology data (Alter et al, 2018) . To integrate the antigen-specific array and gp120-exclusive glycan measurements, we used a form of tensor-based dimensionality reduction, coupled matrix-tensor factorization (CMTF; Fig 1B and C) . By concatenating both the unfolded tensor and matrix during the alternating least squares (ALS) solving for the subject dimension, we achieve the optimal low-rank approximation for both datasets (Fig 1D, see Materials and Methods) . This structure is like canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition on a single tensor, or PCA on a single matrix ( Fig 1D) .

As the datasets were formatted into a three-mode (i.e., axis) 181 × 22 × 39 tensor and a 181 × 25 matrix, we start with a structure of 159,823 entries, of which 95,484 or 60% were filled with measurements ( Fig 1B) . After factorization with 6 components, we are left with four matrices of 181 × 6, 22 × 6, 39 × 6, and 25 × 6. Therefore, we reduce the dataset tõ 1.7% of the size ([181 + 22 + 39 + 25] × 6 = 1,602 numbers), while preserving 62% of its variation (Fig 2A) . For comparison, Fc array assays where these measurements came from with sufficient dynamic range reproduce roughly 80% of the variance across replicates (Brown et al, 2012) . Therefore, we are capturing the majority but not quite all true variation across subjects and measurements. We compared this with the data reduction possible with PCA with the data organized in a flattened matrix form. CMTF consistently led to a similar variance explained with half the resulting factorization size compared with PCA ( Fig 2B) . For example, as indicated by the arrow, CMTF led to a normalized unexplained variance of 0.45 at 1,024 values within the factorization, whereas PCA required 2,048 to do the same. The difference between PCA and CMTF must arise from the latter\\'s ability to \"reuse\" antigen patterns across receptors, or vice versa. For example, if a component includes an increase in FcγRIII binding overall, PCA would still need to represent this increase in the loadings for every FcγRIII-antigen measurement. Thus, PCA is not able to \"group\" interaction effects across the two dimensions. The difference cannot arise through relaxing orthogonality; CMTF is still \"hyper-orthogonal\" (i.e., full rank across all tensor modes), and linearly dependent components would only reduce the total variance explained (Kolda & Bader, 2009 ).

We standardized the data during preprocessing by scaling the matrix so that it contains the same amount of variance as the tensor. In this case, CMTF explains~62% of the tensor and 40% of the matrix variance (R2X). When the matrix is scaled to relatively larger variance, CMTF can achieve~72% matrix R2X, at the expense of the tensor R2X dropping below 35%. Conversely, a smaller matrix does not increase the tensor R2X over 65% but causes the matrix R2X to decrease sharply. Our approach of equal variance scaling tuned the factorization to the range where it was responsive to both datasets. A General description of the data. Antibodies are first separated based on their binding to a panel of disease-relevant antigens. Next, the binding of those immobilized antibodies to a panel of immune receptors is quantified. Other molecular properties of the disease-specific antibody fraction that affect immune engagement, such as glycosylation, may be quantified in parallel in an antigen-specific or -generic manner. These measurements have been shown to predict both disease status (see methods) and immune functional properties-ADCD, ADCC, antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP), and natural killer cell activation measured by IFNγ, CD107a, and MIP1β expression. B Overall structure of the data under the CMTF framework. Antigen-specific measurements can be arranged in a three-dimensional tensor wherein one dimension each indicates subject, antigen, and receptor. In parallel, non-antigen-resolved measurements such as quantification of glycan composition can be arranged in a matrix with each subject along one dimension, and each glycan feature along the other. Although the tensor and matrix differ in their dimensionality, they share a common subject dimension. C The data are reduced by identifying additively separable components represented by the outer product of vectors along each dimension. The subject dimension is shared across both the tensor and matrix reconstruction. D Venn diagram of the variance explained by each factorization method. Canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition can explain the variation present within the tensor on its own (Omberg et al, 2007) , analogous to principal component analysis (PCA) on the glycan matrix. Tensor partial least squares regression (tPLS) allows one to explain the shared covariation between the matrix and tensor (Zhang & Li, 2017) . In contrast, here, we wish to explain the total variation across both the tensor and matrix (Choi et al, 2019) .

In an experiment, subject samples can be limited or only be available for a small set of measurements, or a subset of measurements can be prioritized by investigators based on prior knowledge. Incapable of handling missing values, one may have to exclude incomplete measurements. In the HIV serology data, gp120-specific glycan measurements were available for only half of the subjects. Consequently, models using the glycan measurements required a smaller patient cohort, and when they were included, the prediction performance reduced (Alter et al, 2018) .

Abundance of p24 antigen and its antibody titer has been proposed as an effective marker of HIV progression (Sch€ upbach et al, 2000) , and predictive of death (Rubio Caballero et al, 2000) , although it correlates strongly with viral RNA and CD4+ counts (Sabin et al, 2001) . As we observe with component 4, viremic controllers have been characterized as having especially high p24-specific IgG1 and IgG2 driving phagocytic responses (Tjiam et al, 2015) . The negative association with component 1 likely reflects a decrease in antibody titers overall which has separately been found to predict progression (Tsoukas & Bernard, 1994) . Therefore, although features of p24 abundance or antibody titers may have an incomplete and complex relationship with progression, a p24/gp120 ratio may be more predictive (Fig EV3) .

Although we were able to replicate the difference in dynamics between severe and deceased cases (Fig 6F-H) , the sufficiency of just two patterns argues for quantitative differences in these two patterns, rather than detailed qualitative changes in the immune response . Perceived differences between individual measurements could arise in part from these two component patterns being combined in each measurement.

There is also a challenge in separating pre-existing partial immunity from prior exposures or cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses; some PCR-negative cases showed positive weights on component 2, presumably indicative of long-term humoral responses, possibly from cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses (Fig 6F) (Ng et al, 2020) .

Although each antigen is treated similarly along one dimension, antigenic mutants or strains could also be separated into separate tensor modes before decomposition. This could lead to further data reduction (e.g., both strains of p24 and gp41 antigens share a similar signature; Fig 5C) and simplify comparisons between strains. Differences in the weights would also essentially serve as an unsupervised prediction for competition experiments to reveal differences in the binding targets of polyclonal serum (Georgiev et al, 2013) . As compared with traditional blocking or mutational experiments, antigens in these measurements are multiplexed across identifiable beads (Angeletti et al, 2017; Sesterhenn et al, 2019) . Therefore, making measurements across a wider antigen panel requires just small amounts of each antigen and can be scaled to hundreds of antigens without increased sample requirements.

This will enable surveys for common Fc response patterns across diseases and studies because these different datasets would still share this axis. This \"transfer learning\" could therefore help identify common patterns of immune dysregulation. With more extensive profiling of the various glycosylation and isotype Fc forms, it would be possible to fix the receptor axis of the decomposition, in effect matching new measurements to specific known immunologic patterns.

An expectation of these approximations is that variation within the tensor occurs in a pattern that can be localized to each tensor slice, which is justified by the nature of the measurements being considered. These measurements are made in an array format, wherein plasma samples from subjects are incubated with individually identifiable beads covalently conjugated with antigens (Brown et al, 2012 (Brown et al, , 2017 . The conjugated antigens isolate IgG fractions specific to those targets. After washing, the beads are incubated with fluorescently labelled detection reagents that bind to the isolated IgG depending upon their properties. Thus, in essence, the assay is a bead-based sandwich ELISA, in which IgG is the sandwiched target. Given the format, the amount of fluorescence measured on a given bead should be proportional to both (i) the amount of IgG isolated on the bead and (ii) the fluorescence signal obtained per isolated IgG (two of the tensor modes), supporting their multiplication.

Teachers, particularly those working in more deprived areas, reported that translating the science curriculum for home learning had been difficult, with concerns around resources, internet access and parental ability to help. Some areas of the curriculum posed particular difficulties, leading to a narrowing of topics being taught. Both teachers and parents felt that schools prioritised English and maths above science. Meanwhile some parents reported that their children had engaged in sophisticated extracurricular activities, bolstered by resources available at home and knowledgeable adult help, but others said that their children had done no science at all. Parents who had studied science at post-compulsory level were much more comfortable in helping their children with science home learning.

This is a potentially serious issue because, for young people from backgrounds with little experience of science, school may be their only route via which to 'level up' with their high-science-capital peers. Science capital is a concept used to describe the web of influences and supports that some people access in order to see pursuing science as a realistic and achievable aim for their future. Studies have found (Archer et al. 2015 ) that high science capital has a significant relationship to science-related aspirations and post-compulsory choices. Science capital is somewhat related to social class, in that those with low science capital are more likely to be from less advantaged families.

Phase 1 of the study consisted of two surveys, one of UK primary teachers and one of UK parents/guardians 6 of primary-age children. When designing these surveys, our immediate concern was to avoid placing extra pressure on participants in what was a difficult and stressful situation. We therefore took a conscious decision that the surveys would be short-a maximum of 10 min to complete-and that we would rely solely on passive recruitment methods via social media to attract respondents. Both of these decisions come with drawbacks; a short survey cannot hope to cover the detail that a more lengthy instrument would, while the recruitment method inevitably meant that our sample was self-selecting and that certain groups, for example those not engaged with social media or without ready internet access, are excluded. We acknowledge these drawbacks, but felt that our responsibility to avoid causing participants stress or distress overrode them. We also took the decision that our phase 1 surveys should be anonymous, both to allow people to feel able to speak freely, and to reduce feelings of stress related to participation.

Binding of virus-specific antibodies to viral proteins present on the surface, makes infected cells recognizable for the classical complement pathway, phagocytes and natural killer cells, which will lead to lysis of infected cells (Harper, 1994) . In this study, viral antigens were not detected on the surface of FIPV positive cells isolated from nine cats with FIP. This could implicate that the FIPV positive cells may remain ''invisible'' for the humoral immune system and continue the production of progeny virus without being eliminated. It is not known which mechanism lies behind the absence of surface expressed viral antigens. The results of the cultivation experiment demonstrated that about half of the infected cells are not capable of expressing viral antigens on their surface.

In this study, the presence of MHC I on FIPV positive cells was analyzed. On all FIPV positive cells MHC I was present, showing that no internalization or retention of the MHC I molecules occurs.

The increased cell death may be due to infection or to the response of the immune system on the infected cell. Since no viral antigens are present on the plasma membrane, it can be stated that antibody-mediated lysis is inhibited. The expression of MHC I is not inhibited in infected cells, indicating that the cellular immunity may still be able to lyse the infected cell, if viral peptides are presented. It is generally accepted that a strong cellular immunity enables the cat to overcome infection (Pedersen and Black, 1983; Hayashi et al., 1982; Weiss and Cox, 1989) . However, it has also been postulated that, during a chronic FIPV infection, the cell-mediated lysis is inhibited due to apoptosis and T-cell depletion caused by soluble mediators released during infection (Haagmans et al., 1996; de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005) . Taking into account all these observations, it becomes clear that the outcome of a FIPV infection is a complicated interaction of the immune system and the virus.

NoV are human enteric caliciviruses. The family Caliciviridae belongs to the picornavirus-like superfamily; small, RNA viruses without an envelope. The calicivirus particles (virions) measure between 27 and 38 nm and consist of a spherical protein shell and a genome of a single strand of approximately 7.6 kb positive sense RNA. The caliciviruses known to infect humans belong to two genera: the genus Norovirus and the genus Sapovirus (SaV, formerly known as Sapporo Like Viruses, or typical caliciviruses). In addition, the family holds two genera of animal viruses, named Vesivirus and Lagovirus (Green et al., 2001) . A recently detected bovine calicivirus may be assigned to a fifth genus (Smiley et al., 2003) . The genus NoV is further subdivided into an increasing number of poorly defined genogroups (Karst et al., 2003) . Each genogroup can be subdivided in several genotypes, defined by >80% amino acid homology across the capsid gene, and over 15 genotypes are characterised at the moment . The NoV are officially denoted by the following cryptogram: host species/genus abbreviation/species abbreviation (i.e. genogroup)/strain designation/year of detection/country of origin. For NoVs the strain designation is the location where the strain was first detected, for example: Hu/NV/GGI/Norwalk Virus/1968/US, Hu/NV/GGI/Southampton virus/1991/UK, Hu/NV/GGII/Hawaii virus/1971/US and Hu/NV/GGII /Bristol/ 1993/UK (Green et al., 2001) . Even though in vitro culture systems are not yet available for the NoV (Duizer et al., 2004b) , a considerable quantity of data has been obtained on the structure of the genome and the capsid of these viruses. The NoV genome is organised into a 5'untranslated region (UTR) , the open reading frames (ORF) 1, 2, and 3, a 3'UTR and a poly A tail. ORF1 encodes the nonstructural proteins necessary for virus replication. The major structural protein (VP1) is coded on ORF2, whereas ORF 3 encodes a minor structural protein (VP2) Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al., 2003) .

Replication in other human tissues has not been detected, and even though NoV genotypes were found in cattle (e.g. bovine Jenavirus, GGI) and pigs (e.g. porcine enteric calicivirus, GGII), none of these animal genotypes have ever been detected in human patients.\", 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'The noroviruses'}, {'text': \"The NoV are the major causative agents of classical viral gastroenteritis in all age groups (De Wit et al., 2001a) .

An interesting method for typing of recombinants is described by Kageyama et al. (2003) , who suggest amplification of the ORF1-ORF2 junction region, a fragment overlapping the RdRp and capsid gene. In that way, sequencing of just one fragment should suffice to type the strain and to discriminate between recombinants and 'old' strains. However, this will apply only when the recombination event has occurred in the junction region. There is at this time not enough information available to assume the junction region is the only recombination site.\", 'cite_spans': [{'start': 585, 'end': 606, 'text': 'Atmar and Estes, 2001', 'ref_id': None}, {'start': 675, 'end': 697, 'text': 'Kageyama et al.

After it was discovered that expression of the NoV ORF2 by recombinant baculoviruses in insect cells resulted in the self-assembling of the capsid protein into virus like particles (VLPs, Green et al., 1993) , many antigen-based detection methods have been developed. The VLPs were first used to detect antibodies to NoV in serum samples (Green et al., 1993; Parker et al., 1993) . Later, sera from animals inoculated with VLPs were used to develop enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for the detection of NoVs in faeces (Jiang et al., 1995; Herrmann et al., 1995) . Currently, several EIAs to detect NoV antigens are commercially available Burton-Macleod et al., 2004) ; they are slightly less sensitive than RT-PCR methods, but since the EIAs can be applied by non-specialised laboratories and results can be obtained within 3-4 hours, these assays will be increasingly used to diagnose gastroenteritis outbreaks.

It is clear that fundamental knowledge on virus particles, sensitive and specific detection methods for the viruses in patients, foods and environmental samples and epidemiological data are all prerequisites for 'virus tracking'. Virus tracking is a method aimed to answer questions also posed in standard outbreak investigations such as 'which virus strain is causing this outbreak, where did it come from and how did it get into the susceptible population?'. Additionally, with virus tracking one strives to answer questions such as 'how is this strain evolving, and why is it emerging (here and now)?'. Virus tracking is cleverly combining virological and epidemiological data, and adding molecular epidemiology to the formula. Molecular epidemiology has been defined by Janice S. Dorman as 'a science that focuses on the contribution of potential genetic and environmental risk factors, identified at the molecular level, to the aetiology, distribution and prevention of disease within families and across populations'. Here we will describe how virus tracking of foodborne viruses was done in a European research project conducted by the 'Foodborne Viruses in Europe (FBVE)' network (http://www.eufoodborneviruses.net/). When fully operational, this approach will contribute to more rapid and internationally standardised assessment of the spread of foodborne viral pathogens. Mapping these pathways will allow identification of high-risk foods or processing methods, as well as high-risk import/transport routes, which subsequently can be targeted by prevention programmes.\", 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Virus tracking'}, {'text': 'An important aspect of studying diseases internationally is having a platform in place for exchange, collection and sharing of data. Additionally, to understand modes of transmission of viruses, or to recognise a common source outbreak, combining molecular virological data with epidemiological data is essential. Key to this approach is the development of two linked and searchable databases ( Fig. 4.2) . One database aggregates harmonised epidemiological data, which can be entered in an outbreak investigation form via the Internet. To obtain that goal, a minimum dataset needs to be identified and agreed upon. Relevant questions were on the symptoms of the illness, route of transmission, setting of the outbreak, involvement of foods, and the extent of diagnostic evaluation. A web-based questionnaire is an efficient way for collection of information during outbreaks of (viral) gastroenteritis . The other database aggregates virological sequence data, and can be linked with the epidemiological data collection. Sequences can be submitted directly or -ideally -through the web-based outbreak investigation form. It is clear that for matching of sequences all participating labs need to perform RT-PCR assays that target the same or at least overlapping parts of the genome. Within the FBVE consortium the partners all used their own favourite PCR protocol for amplification of a part of the RdRp gene. This resulted in several different PCR products. There was, however, a minimal overlap of a 63 nucleotides fragment. In April 2004, the epidemiological and virological database contained 1,969 and 4,173 entries, respectively. Next to the genomic region coding for the RdRp, many sequences of the ORF2, coding for the capsid protein have been collected. Cross reference of these two databases showed that 92% of non-bacterial gastroenteritis outbreaks were associated with NoV. Other enteric viruses detected were astrovirus, hepatitis A virus, rotavirus, and sapovirus. Overall, 10% of outbreaks were reported to be food-or waterborne. These outbreaks were significantly larger than outbreaks attributed to person-to-person transmission. A vehicle was reported in only 37% of outbreaks. In total, 69% of all the NoV outbreaks were associated with just one NoV strain, Grimsby virus. The Grimsby virus belongs to the Genogroup II.4 viruses (GGII.4, reference strain: Hu/NV/GGII/Bristol/1993/UK, other GGII.4 strains are Lordsdale virus and Camberwell virus). The proportion of Grimsby virus was highest in the winter of 2001/2002, when a novel variant Grimsby virus was detected across Europe. The Grimsby viruses were significantly more frequently detected in outbreaks labelled as person-to-person outbreaks than in food-or waterborne outbreaks, and in healthcare settings compared with other settings (FBVE network, unpublished data). In 2002, the emergence of a distinct variant GGII.4 virus made it to the headlines of the public media since this strain caused a tremendous increase in the number of outbreaks in UK hospitals and on international cruises.

Comparing viral genomes, at the sequence level, from samples that appear epidemiologically linked is the only way to conclusively identify common source outbreaks as such. It is clear that the accuracy of this method is dependent on the length of the fragment, the genome region, and the variation present between the virus strains under investigation. Although NoV are highly variable, and finding identical sequences in food or patient samples from different outbreaks indicates that these may be linked, the data need to be interpreted against a background of population-based data, orminimally -data from outbreak surveillance. For instance, in the years 1996 and 2002, an epidemic wave of outbreaks occurred over a wide geographic region, in which a single variant NoV belonging to GGII.4 emerged. In these periods, finding identical sequences within the GGII.4 genogroup in different outbreaks meant nothing, other than that it was apparently an outbreak involved in the epidemic.

The initial international outbreak occurred in three countries in association with consumption of imported oysters from France that met all microbiological quality assurance parameters. The GGIIb variant caused between 7 and 71% of all recognised NoV outbreaks detected during that season in different countries. Further characterisation of the new lineage of viruses showed a remarkable finding, namely that the newly recognised ORF1 region was associated with four different capsids. These capsids were similar to previously recognised NoVs. The conclusion was that the detected lineages in these series of outbreaks were in fact new NoV variants, generated through recombination.', 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': [], 'section': 'Mechanisms of emergence: examples from FBVE'}, {'text': 'Not enough is known on the immunity to NoV infections to speculate on how an existing capsid can be advantageous for a virus lineage to allow emergence based on such a recombination event.

In the oyster-associated outbreaks, multiple variants were detected within the same product. Eating oysters (or other filter-feeding shellfish) contaminated with multiple strains, or ingesting multiple-contaminated products may lead to co-infection of people with related viruses, thereby facilitating the process of virus recombination (Fig. 4.3) . This example clearly demonstrates that foodborne and waterborne transmission may have serious impact on the spread -and possibly even the generation -of emerging viral infections across countries.

The new virus which emerged in January 2002 had a distinct sequence in the gene coding for the RdRp, had not been seen previously and was the dominant cause of NoV outbreaks by mid summer in all but one of the countries participating in the FBVE network (Lopman et al., 2004) . Further research is needed to understand if and how the observed changes translate to distinct biological properties such as infectivity, antigenicity or (environmental) stability of the new strain. The example does show that the network approach used is suited to detect and investigate the emergence of a new strain. Interestingly, the strain correlated to the increase in NoV outbreaks in 2002 is related to the strains that emerged in the winter of 1995-1996, and again in 2004-2005 In all cases a global epidemic of No V outbreaks was observed.

What does that tell us about food-related risks for other viruses, especially the structurally similar viruses, such as enteroviruses (e.g. poliovirus, coxsackie viruses), hepatitis A virus, and hepatitis E virus? The basic properties that contribute to foodborne transmission, such as asymptomatic carriage and shedding, environmental stability, oral infectivity, and low minimal infectious dose are similar to those of the NoVs. Several examples of food-and water-related outbreaks with these viruses exist. The biggest difference with NoVs is that enteroviruses, hepatitis A and hepatitis E viruses cause illness in a smaller proportion of those exposed, and that these symptoms become noticeable up to ten weeks post infection. As a result, a relation between the illness and a food source will not be made unless it is very obvious, for instance, because a group of cases all participated in the same conference.

Epidemiological and laboratory studies have, however, shown that a major proportion of the SARS cases in Hong Kong has been linked to environmental transmission due to a faulty sewage system (WHO, 2003) . Moreover, SARS coronavirus is found to infect intestinal epithelial cells in humans and the majority of SARS patients shed high loads of infectious virus in their stools (Leung et al., 2003) , SARS coronavirus is relatively stable in the environment (Duan et al., 2003) , coronaviruses in animals are known for their dual tissue tropism (respiratory and enteric), and food animal handlers in Guangdong had increased prevalence of antibodies against the SARS virus (CDC, 2003). Thus, with increasing data becoming available, one can question if the dropletbased respiratory transmission is truly the only mode of transmission. All the factors mentioned suggest that the potential of transmission of SARS coronavirus via human faecal waste is there. During the major outbreak in 2003, foodborne transmission has not been documented, but the latest SARS cases in Guangdong that occurred in December/January 2004 were linked to two restaurants.

Such a reallocation of health care capacity results in the effective management of this epidemiological problem 1 . The staff has undergone on-line 36-hour training course to become qualified in coronavirus infection treatment.The surgeons of COVID-19 dedicated hospitals do rarely practice surgery. When ICU patients need mechanical ventilation, percutaneous tracheostomy under endoscopic control is mostly performed, as it decreases the aerosol formation, viral load on staff and complications, associated with an endotracheal tube in comparison with surgical tracheostomy 2 . However, it is still associated with the risk of aerosol formation, so different approaches should be considered for a long-time perspective 3 .The majority of the studies dedicated to colorectal diseases are temporarily paused. The teaching and training are mostly translated via online platforms, which has excluded the opportunity to get clinical experience in surgery 4 .The approach to patient routing has changed significantly. If one is not diagnosed with COVID-19 CT scan and laboratory testing are provided immediately. The patients should be admitted to the surgical department, where treatment is provided only to those COVID-19 negative.The patient isolated for more than 2 weeks and COVID-19 negative as a result of 2 subsequent tests is admitted to the surgical department with an option to readmission to the infectious department and can be treated by surgical staff, which does not work with COVID-19 positive patients.The patient, diagnosed with coronavirus infection and treated at home is admitted to COVID-19 dedicated multidisciplinary hospital, where surgical care is provided. Those treated in infectious diseases hospital or COVID-19 dedicated centre are managed by the surgical team present.Surgery has become highly elective, being mostly available for high-risk patients with emergencies, malignancies, cardiovascular pathologies or infections. Preoperative testing in surgical patients with respiratory symptoms and history of travelling or contacting with COVID-19 positive people and postoperative recovery in the operating unit seem to be highly effective measures 5 .
